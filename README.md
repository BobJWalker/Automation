Automation scripts to make life a little better

## Computer Setup
The computer setup section contains a series of scripts to help setup a machine quickly and with as much automation as possible.  Rather than spend hours or even days having a developer run through a "getting started" guide these scripts will do all the heavy lifting for them.  The end goal is for them to kick off the script, go to lunch, or a meeting, and come back and have a working computer.

### Requirements
A good chunk of the install scripts take advantage of [Chocolatey.org](https://www.chocolatey.org/).  You will need to make sure you have installed by following [this guide](https://www.chocolatey.org/install).

### Running Computer Setup Scripts
You will need to run the main script [BootStrapDeveloperMachine.ps1](https://github.com/CodeAperture/Automation/blob/master/ComputerSetup/BootstrapDeveloperMachine.ps1) as an administrator via PowerShell.
